# Adpative versus Responsive Website Design


## Introduction

**Adaptive design** has multiple fixed layout sizes. When the site detects the available space, it selects the layout most appropriate for the screen

**Responsive design** responds to changes in browser width by adjusting the placement of design elements to fit in the available space

## Pros and Cons

-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Pros of Responsive Design

- Easier, cheaper and more efficient to implement
- One single design is created to work across all screen sizes
- Consistency and uniformity of design across all devices

### Cons of Responsive Design

- Less control over design - elements get shuffled as screen size changes
- Slower load times on mobile devices - must load 100% of the website data even if only 70% of data is needed for user to interact with mobile site
- Client-side rendering

### Pros of Adaptive Design

- Faster and lighter loading - focus on mobile optimization
- Templates are selected based on the device size through server-side device detection
- Offers more personalized user experience

### Cons of Adaptive Design

- More costly to implement - requires more time and typically a larger team of creators
- Requires more maintenance 
- Not every screen size will have a designated template - unless a company wants and is willing to pay for additional templates
- Not as SEO friendly depending on the implementation


## Argument for Adaptive Design

### Why should you use adaptive design?

- ‘Google likes websites that load fast, and so do users.’ (even though they prefer responsive sites)
- Users interact differently with sites based on the device they are using to view the site
- Reactive design gives a company the ability to adjust their designs and layouts to provide the best user experience based on the user’s device
- UX UX UX UX

**For example:** 
a user is more likely to book a flight and choose seats on their desktop, but are much more likely to check in and keep up with gates and departure times using their mobile devices
